1. Adding expiration deaders.

Thiswill help to improve perfomance. 
The point of using browser caching and expiry headers is to reduce the number of HTTP requests, 
which improves the performance for your returning visitors.

The first time someone visits the site, their browser will fetch all  images, css files, javascript files, etc. 
Normally that happens every time the same visitor comes back to the site.

With Expires headers we tell our website visitor’s browser that the files you specify are not changing until after a certain time, for example a month.

This means that the browser doesn’t have to to re-fetch images, css, javascript etc every time your visitor comes back to our site.

2. CSS delivery optimization:

Remove render-blocking JavaScript:

    http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/js/disable.js
    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/offline.js
    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/scripts/jquery-1.11.0.min.js
    https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js
    http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js

Optimize CSS Delivery of the following:

    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/style/alertify.core.css
    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/style/style_test.css
    http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600
    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/style/menubar_test.css
    http://lk-consulting.azurewebsites.net/source/style/bootstrap.min.css
	
Unfortunately, we have not done this because accoring to this tutorial: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeCSSDelivery
We will have to put css and js inside the HTML which comes against this cource's requirements.

3. Optimized image

If we will use compressed image then the quality of it will not be so good.

4. Leverage browser cashing
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache

NB! https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#cache-control
According to this diagramm we made our site none cashed.

OUR RESULT:

MOBILE: 1. Speed 64/100 and User experience 100/100
DESKTOP: Suggestions Summary  84/100
