1. Adding expiration deaders.

Thiswill help to improve perfomance. 
The point of using browser caching and expiry headers is to reduce the number of HTTP requests, 
which improves the performance for your returning visitors.

The first time someone visits the site, their browser will fetch all  images, css files, javascript files, etc. 
Normally that happens every time the same visitor comes back to the site.

With Expires headers we tell our website visitor’s browser that the files you specify are not changing until after a certain time, for example a month.

This means that the browser doesn’t have to to re-fetch images, css, javascript etc every time your visitor comes back to our site.
